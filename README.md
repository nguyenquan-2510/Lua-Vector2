# Vector2 Data Type written in Lua

As y'all know that Lua just have table as its only data structure
So I created it. To be more specific, recreated it. I think this has been created be4

We can perfrom adding 2 vectors, substract, multiply by a number
or perfrom dot product of two vectors ( tích vô hướng cho dễ hiểu )

More features will be updated ( if I was not lazy xD )

Basically it is just a table but have advanced configs for vector operations
So when use type() -> return "table"

Version 1.0.0: + - * /

Version 1.0.1: Display error when calling a vector as a function

Version 1.0.2: Added comparison
